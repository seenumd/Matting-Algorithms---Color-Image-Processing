Project Abstract:
project deals with image matting techniques. Matting refers to the process
of extracting foreground objects from a known or partially known background. The
extracted foreground objects may then be placed in scenes containing arbitrary backgrounds.
Matting is heavily used in motion-picture industry. There exist a variety
of algorithms for matting based on foreground and known background properties.
In the project, two standard algorithms for matting opaque foreground objects on
known fixed colour backgrounds are implemented. In addition, a new algorithm that
enables matting of opaque objects on variable colour background is also implemented.
The second part of the work concerns matting of transparent, reflective and
translucent objects. Matting algorithms in these cases are much more complex as
they involve not only extraction of the foreground object but the reflections of the
background on the foreground and the distortions induced in the background by the
optical properties of the foreground object. In literature, these effects are given the
title, environment matting. This part of the work is only partially completed because
of the difficulty in generating the necessary images for extracting matting information.
The algorithms implemented and their results are shown on several images. It is
concluded that matting of transparent objects is still a challenging research problem
and its solution would lead to creation of many special effects.
